# Berny Curvature Library

Berny is a Unity project whos purpose is to provide fully in-source support for 
SVGs and Bezier curves.

The name is a homage to Sergei Natanovich Bernstein - Bernstein as in the
Bernstein polynomials and basis functions - which is the foundation of
Bezier curves.

This library has minimal functionality for loading, saving and editing Bezier
paths and SVGs, but is in current development.

# Intall
To install, copy the Script library to your project. The library is under
the namespace PxPre.Berny.

# Preview
For a basic preview, see the scene in Testing/Scenes/SampleScene.unity.

It contains a test scene where the Test GameObject can be selected to 
edit a path in the scene, along with controls in the Inspector for it.
